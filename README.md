- Address validation warnings in real-time
- Ensure proper zoning (quiet areas away from noisy ones)
- Verify adequate volume per crew member

### 5. **Export & Share**
- Export design as JSON file
- Share with community for feedback
- Load preset configurations for quick starts

## NASA Guidelines Implemented

### **Volume Requirements (per crew member)**
- **Sleep**: 2.5-4.0 m¬≥ minimum
- **Food Preparation**: 1.0-2.0 m¬≥
- **Hygiene**: 0.5-1.0 m¬≥
- **Exercise**: 3.0-5.0 m¬≥
- **Workstation**: 1.0-2.0 m¬≥
- **Recreation**: 1.5-3.0 m¬≥
- **Medical**: 2.0-4.0 m¬≥
- **Storage**: 0.8-1.5 m¬≥
- **Total Habitable**: 25-50 m¬≥ minimum

### **Zoning Best Practices**
- **Quiet Zones**: Sleep and work areas isolated from noise
- **Active Zones**: Exercise and recreation with good ventilation
- **Wet Zones**: Hygiene facilities with proper waste management
- **Clean Zones**: Medical and food areas separated from contamination
- **Technical Zones**: Life support and maintenance accessible but isolated
- **Social Zones**: Recreation areas centrally located for crew interaction

### **Adjacency Rules**
- Exercise areas near hygiene facilities
- Food preparation near storage areas
- Sleep quarters away from noisy equipment
- Medical bay in clean, isolated location
- Life support systems accessible but separated from living areas
